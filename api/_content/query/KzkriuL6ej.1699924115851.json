It's a quite neat service that allows you to do product search without manually embedding images, setting up a vector database, manipulating images etc. The pricing is quite predictable with 1 USD per 10000 images stored and 4.50 USD per 1000 queries using images.\nThe service has not been updated much by Google, and it has no graphical interface in the Cloud Console, which makes it a bit hard to use. This, together with the first generation of Google Cloud AI services, seem to be neglected in favor of the new Vertex AI.","date":"2023-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","language":"english","draft":false,"layout":"article","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Google offers a managed service for searching with images to find similar products called "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://cloud.google.com/vision/product-search/docs","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Product Search"}]},{"type":"text","value":".

If the goal is to find similar products one time, then this could be done in a Python workbench for a negligible cost.
