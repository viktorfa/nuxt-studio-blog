So we get situations when half of John Bolton's face is shown on the link preview or something like that.\nContent creators can crop a custom photo for the social sharing purpose, but this can be tedious.\nSome big sites seem to always do this, perhaps automatically, to make really good social share preview images with a relevant image and perhaps some text and/or logo laid on top.\nBut there's no easy way to do this for most sites, as we can see by observing the bad state of social share preview images around the web."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Social share preview image of a post on Slate Star Codex.

This can seem like too much for, say a developer who wants better preview images for her blog, which is why a strategy for my service could be to make it dead simple to get started with."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Placid allows free (as in beer) use of its API, but not with your own templates. There's a technical reason for this, as you can't really control who uses an API of this kind. Each person using the API will cost some money to the server owner, so my idea only works if enough people pay for a premium version. Perhaps by being really lean, the costs will be low enough for such a business model to work."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Maybe my product could have a landing page with a preview generator and the exact url need to create that.
