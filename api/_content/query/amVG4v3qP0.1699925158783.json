The issue was some files of the Symfony Polyfill libraries. They contain code that is only compatible with PHP 8. The code is not supposed to run on older versions of PHP, but the Wordpress SVN validator will check all uploaded files whether they run or not. Since the Wordpress server doesn't have PHP 8 yet, it will raise an error.","date":"2022-03-04 08:00:00 +0000","categories":["wordpress","development","php","svn"],"layout":"post","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:posts:how-to-fix-php-error-in-wordpress-plugin:index.md","_source":"content","_file":"posts/how-to-fix-php-error-in-wordpress-plugin/index.md","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/posts/how-to-fix-php-error-in-wordpress-plugin","images":[]}},{"_path":"/posts","_dir":"","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Archive","description":"","layout":"page","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:posts:index.md","_source":"content","_file":"posts/index.md","_extension":"md","sitemap":{"loc":"/posts","images":[]}}]
