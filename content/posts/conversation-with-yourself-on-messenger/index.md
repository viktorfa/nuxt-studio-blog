Did you know it's possible to have a conversation with yourself on Facebook Messenger? I discovered it by accident when creating a share button for my grocery price comparison site [https://allematpriser.no](https://allematpriser.no). It's convenient to have a convo with yourself as it makes it possible to easily share text and files between your devices.

1. Click <button>
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.vikfand.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THIS BUTTON</a>
   </button> and wait until Facebook is loaded.
2. Select **Private Message** or similar if in another language.
   <div style="max-width: 320px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
     <img src="share-to-messenger-step-1.png" alt="Step 2: Click share with friends." title="Step 2: Click share with friends." />
   </div>
3. Find yourself by searching.
   <div style="max-width: 320px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
     <img src="share-to-messenger-step-2.png" alt="Step 3: Find yourself as the recipient." title="Step 3: Find yourself as the recipient." />
   </div>
4. Click **send** and wait.

You can now check Messenger on your computer or phone and use your private conversation however you want.
